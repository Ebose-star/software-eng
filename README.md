#The useState hook is used to manage the state of the employee list, along with the name and value fields for adding new employees.
#When the user types in the input fields for name and value, the handleNameChange and handleValueChange functions update the corresponding state variables.
#Clicking the "Add Employee" button triggers the handleAddEmployee function, which updates the employee list with the new data and resets the name and value fields. 
#The employee list is displayed using the map function to create a list item for each employee.
